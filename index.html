        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Brittany Ramirez, and I'm 23 years old. I'm a proud mom to a beautiful one year old daughter who inspires everything I do. I am currently an apprentice at Road To Hire, where I'm developing both my soft skills and technical skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As part of my learning journey, I created this functional webpage and calculator for one of our projects. Before entering the tech world, I worked in the medical field, gaining experience in medical assisting, interpreting, and medical billing and coding. Transitioning into tech has allowed me to combine my passion for helping others with my love for problem solving. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and expanding my skills every day.</p>
